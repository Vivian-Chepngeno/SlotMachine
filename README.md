This Python script simulates a simple slot machine game. Here's an overview of the program and how it works:

Key Components:
1.Game Constants:
MAX_LINES: Maximum number of lines the player can bet on.
MAX_BET and MIN_BET: Defines the betting range.
ROWS and COLS: Set up a 3x3 grid (standard slot machine format).
2.Symbol Count and Values:
symbol_count: Defines how many times each symbol can appear on the slot machine.
symbol_value: Assigns each symbol a value, which determines the payout.
3.Functions:
  1.check_winnings():
  This function checks if there is a winning line based on the symbols displayed on the machine.
 It multiplies the symbol value by the bet and returns the winnings along with the lines that won.
  2.get_slot_machine_spin():
   It generates the slot machine's spin by randomly selecting symbols for each column while ensuring the correct distribution of symbol counts.
  3.print_slot_machine():
   This function displays the generated slot machine columns in a row-wise format so the user can see the results.
 4.deposit():
  It asks the player for an initial deposit amount and validates that itâ€™s a positive integer.
 5.get_number_of_lines():
  Prompts the player to enter the number of lines they want to bet on, limited to the range between 1 and MAX_LINES.
 6.get_bet():
  Asks the player how much they want to bet on each line, ensuring that it is within the allowed range between MIN_BET and MAX_BET.
 7.spin():
  This is the core gameplay loop. It:
  Asks for the number of lines to bet on.
  Ensures the player has enough balance for their bet.
  Spins the slot machine, checks for winnings, and updates the balance.
  Displays the spin result and winnings, if any.
 8.main():
  The main loop of the game. It:
  Starts by asking the player to deposit money.
 Lets the player keep playing until they choose to quit (by pressing "q").
 Prints the remaining balance when they quit.
